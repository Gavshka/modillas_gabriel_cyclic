Assignment 02 - Coding the Cyclic Graph
Instruction: Create a program using C, C++, or Java only. The program will determine if the given graph represented in a 2D adjacency matrix is cyclic or not, and display the vertices in the cycle. There should be 2 implementations, 1 using DFS and 2 using BFS. Create a repository on your GitHub account following the naming convention (famname_givenname_cyclic). This repo should contain at least 2 files: 1 (cyclic_dfs) and 2 (cyclic_bfs). Don't forget to make it public and submit the link here.
